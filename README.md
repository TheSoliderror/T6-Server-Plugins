# T6-Server-Plugins

# About
This is some of my public plugins that I used on my T6 servers. It is worth noting that these will no longer be updated as the public plugins cannot be the exact same as my servers so I can keep a little higher end. However feel free to use these plugins and edit them or sample them.

# Installation
* Download Feds T6 GSC Utils Plugin [here](https://github.com/fedddddd/t6-gsc-utils/releases/download/v1.9.5/t6-gsc-utils.dll) THIS PLUGIN ONLY WORKS ON SERVERS!
* Install the plugin to %localappdata%/plutonium/storage/t6/plugins (you have to create the plugins folder)
# Not all my scripts use this, and but most do.
* Now download the script of your choice and put them in the %localappdata%/plutonium/storage/t6/scripts folder (you have to create the scripts folder)
# Non-GSC-utils scripts
* The Zombie counter can be used solo and in a server, and does not require the plugin
# GSC-utils scripts
* Solids Map Chooser
